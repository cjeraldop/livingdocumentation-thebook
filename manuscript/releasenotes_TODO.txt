Dear readers,
Thanks for your support on this book! I'm happy to give you some news about the book Living Documentation. It has grown a lot over the last months, with 400 pages now. Many new chapters and sections were added.

All the content is mostly there now. the completion rate is only 99% because it should still get some editing to fix typos, improve the writing style and remove extraneous verbiage.

Also, some big news
