2O+ parts

Dear readers,
Thanks for your support on this book! Here's another update of the book, with more than 20 new parts, for example on Conversations & Working Collectively.

There's a chapter dedicated to having the code be its own documentation, and other patterns that also leverage code and configuration files for documentation purposes: Declarative Automation & Small Scale Simulation. This is just a subset. The book is still a draft, but now it gives a clear ideas of what it's about. Don't hesitate to send feedback on what you like or what you'd expect, and ask any questions.
