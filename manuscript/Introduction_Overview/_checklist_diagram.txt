# Knowledge Exploitation & Augmentation Checklist // knowledge already there

Where's the knowledge right now?
In people's head? -> encode somewhere as text, code, metadata etc.
Already represented?

exploitable, or obfuscated or unrecoverable?
too abundant?
accessible for the intended audience?
in one single place or fragmented?
What's missing to make it 100% explicit?

# Knowledge Evolution // maintenance, stable vs. volatile

How stable is this knowledge?
If it changes, what does change at the same time?
If there's a redundant knowledge, how to make the redundant sources in sync?
