# Specific vs. Generic Knowledge

There is knowledge that is specific to your company, your particular system or your business domain, and there is knowledge that is generic and shared with many other people in many other companies in the industry.

## Generic Knowledge

Knowledge about programming languages, developers tools, software patterns and practices belongs to the Generic knowledge category. Examples include: DDD, patterns, CI, using Puppet, Git tutorial etc.

Knowledge about mature sectors of the business industries is also generic knowledge. Even in very competitive areas like Pricing in finance or Supply Chain Optimization in e-commerce, most of the knowledge is public and available in industry-standard books, and only a small part of the business is specific and confidential for a while.

For example each business domain has its essential reading lists, with books often referred to as "The Bible of the field": Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives (9th Edition) by John C Hull, Logistics and Supply Chain Management (4th Edition) by Martin Christopher etc.

The good news is that generic knowledge is already documented in the industry literature. There are books, blog posts, conference talks that describe it quite well. There are standard vocabularies to talk about it. There are trainings available to learn it faster with knowledgable people.

## Learn generic knowledge

You also learn generic knowledge by doing your job of course, but mostly by reading books and attending trainings and conferences. This only takes a few hours, and you know beforehand what you're going to learn, how long it will take and how much it will cost. It's almost as easy to learn generic knowledge as going to the store to buy food.

Generic knowledge is basically a solved problem. This knowledge is ready-made, ready to be reused by everyone. When you use it, you just have to link to an authoritative source and you're done documenting. This is as simple as putting an Internet link or a bibliographic reference.

## Focus on Specific Knowledge

Specific knowledge is the one your company and team has that is not (yet) shared with other peers in the same industry. This knowledge is more expensive to learn, it takes practicing, making mistakes and failures to earn it. That's the kind of knowledge that deserves most attention, because only you can take care about it. It's the specific knowledge that deserves the biggest efforts from you and your colleagues. As a professional, you should know enough of the generic, industry standard knowledge, in order to be able to focus on growing the knowledge that's specific to your particular ambitions.

Specific knowledge is valuable, and cannot be found ready-made, so it's the kind of knowledge you'll have to take care of.
