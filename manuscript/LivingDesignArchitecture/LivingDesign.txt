# Living Design & Architecture

Design is not a phase, it's a concern we keep in mind when coding.

Software design is about deciding carefully between all the possible ways to code the same behavior. Or in Jeremie Chassaing's words: "it's picking one in gazillions of possibilities with good reasons." Hence the frequent objection during design discussions: "but it's the same thing at the end!" Yes it is. If you just care about making it work, design is irrelevant. Design is when you care about concerns beyond just making it work.

If you practice TDD, design is what you do in the third step "Refactoring", after creating a failing test (specs) and making it work with just enough code.

Even if you don't, design means trying things only to change them later when we know better. Being serious about design means continuous changes of the design and the code which embodies the design.

The code as you see it is a consequence of all the past design decisions. You can recognize many of these past decisions just by looking at the code base, but you'll miss many as well.

Living Documentation of design is precisely about finding practices that help explain more design decisions accurately, without slowing down the continuous flow of changes that we make when we design.


# The design skills pre-requisite

Even if you start a Living Documentation journey with the goal of solving the documentation problem, you'll quickly discover that your actual problem is that the design is poor or arbitrary: "design by coincidence". To solve the documentation problems you have to solve the design problems. This is all good news indeed!

**Through the focus on documentation you end up with a concrete visible criteria for everyone to see the big mess that is the current state of the design.**

This becomes a positive pressure to improve the design, which has benefits well exceeding the sole benefits of documentation per se. But as we've mentioned before, there's even more good news for you:

**Good design skills also make good living documentation skills.**

Focus on living documentation, and focus on design skills. Practice both together and everything will get better!
