## Project Overview

Let's assume that we have a project with source code well organized into packages, layers etc. Its Vision Statement, the Bounded Contexts and their Ubiquitous Language are stored as text files at the root of the project. The relationships between contexts and the possible Anti-corruption layers used could also be described there.

During development many of the programming language elements (interfaces, classes, methods, packages) have been annotated with patterns annotations to declare every pattern (DDD, GoF, Fowler Analysis and PoEAA patterns in particular) that we know are present at the design and architecture levels.

Even the frameworks used may have been also declared using the pattern vocabulary. For example the ORM would be declared as being a Data Mapper.
