## Living Diagram examples

- Sub-types of a type: FixedIncome <- Bond, Swap, Future, FRA // built-I'm most IDE on-demand
- Message / debugging object graph (quasi actual example)
- circle of a cyclic group Rock > Scissor > Paper > Rock
- Tree of hierarchical config file entries (log.properties) // not sure it's very useful
- runtime test results chart // payments over time
- physical view from code written for that purpose // see blog using neo4j to graph
(- pattern with its collaborators)
- core domain / abstract core
- hexagonal architecture
- tribe around a concept // close to aggregate
- context mapping // from annotations? Misses the point of a diagnostic tool
(the sound of Fizzbuzz)
