## Visual Tests

Tests that don't assert the result but instead print the result in a visual format for people to review.

During exploratory development, for example during a spike, when the problems are not clear and you're not sure how to solve them, you want quick feedback anyway. Usually tests are great at providing this feedback, but in this case it's difficult to decide what to assert, and it will change a lot very soon while you discover the problem more in-depth. You need something cheaper

### An example with Model-based testing

Oracle as a simpler documentation of the workflow / processing as opposed to the full thing that's much more complicated in its implementation

The model based testing generates a reference documentation as a catalogue of sequence diagrams. It's proved useful for developers regularly, to explain specific portions of behaviors.
