NoDocumentation is a manifesto for exploring alternatives to traditional forms of documentation.

> We acknowledge the purpose of documentation, but we disagree with the way it's usually done. #NoDocumentation is about exploring better alternatives for transferring knowledge between people and across time.

T> Documentation is only a mean, not an end. It's only a tool, not a product.

So far, here are some of the ideas that belong to the #NoDocumentation quest:

- Conversations over Documentation
- Declarative Automation
- Shameful Documentation
- Enforced Decisions
- Make It Easy to Do the Right Thing
- Scaffolding
- On-demand Documentation
- Throw-Away Documentation
- All forms of collective work: Pair-Programming, Mob Programming, Specification Workshops, Communities of Practice

 #NoDocumentation: Make documentation redundant!

> We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes. #agilemanifesto
