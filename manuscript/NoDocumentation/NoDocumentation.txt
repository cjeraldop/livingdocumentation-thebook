'#NoDocumentation' is a manifesto for exploring alternatives to traditional forms of documentation.

> We acknowledge the purpose of documentation, but we disagree with the way it's usually done. #NoDocumentation is about exploring better alternatives for transferring knowledge between people and across time.

T> Documentation is only a mean, not an end. It's only a tool, not a product.

Here are some ideas under the #NoDocumentation tag:

- Conversations over Documentation
- Continuous Training
- All forms of collective work: Pair-Programming, Mob Programming, Specification Workshops, Communities of Practice
- Declarative Automation
- Shameful Documentation
- Enforced Decisions
- Make It Easy to Do the Right Thing
- Making mistakes impossible
- Scaffolding
- On-demand Documentation
- Throw-Away Documentation


'#NoDocumentation': Make documentation redundant!
