# Conversations Over Formal Documentation

> Having conversations, Is more important then documenting conversations, Is more important then automating conversations
> -- Liz Kheogh


Written documentation is often the default choice when it comes about documentation, to the point that the word "Documentation" has become a close synonymous to "written document".

However it's unlucky. When we need documentation, we mean that there's a need for knowledge transfer from some people to other people. The bad news is that not all media are equal when it comes to their efficiency of transferring knowledge.

Alistair Cockburn analyzed three dozen projects, over the course of two decades. He [reported](http://alistair.cockburn.us/ASD+book+extract%3A+%22Communicating,+cooperating+teams%22) on his findings in books and articles, with a famous diagram illustrating the effectiveness of different modes of communication.

This diagram recaps his observation that people working and talking together at the whiteboard is the most effective mode of communication, whereas paper is the least effective.

Most of the time, effective sharing of knowledge is best done by simply talking, asking and answering questions instead of written documents.

**Therefore: Favor conversations between everybody involved over written documents. Conversations are interactive, fast, convey feelings and have a high bandwidth as opposed to all written artifacts.**

Conversations are:

- **High-Bandwidth**: conversations offer a high bandwidth compared to writing plus reading, as more knowledge can be efficiently communicated over a given period of time
- **Interactive**:  both sides of the conversation have the opportunity to ask for clarification and orient the topic on what's most useful for them, whenever they want to
- **Just In Time**: both sides of the conversation only talk about what's of interest for them

These key properties of conversations make them the most effective form of communication for sharing knowledge.

In contrast, written documentation is not just wasteful because it takes time to write, but also because it takes time to locate where the relevant parts are, and then it's unlikely the content will fit the expectations. Even worse, it's likely that the content will be misunderstood.


## Wiio's laws

Wiio's laws are humoristically formulated serious observations about how human communication usually fails except by accident, by Professor Osmo Antero Wiio.

>  Communication usually fails, except by accident.
>
>  If communication can fail, it will.
>
> - If communication cannot fail, it still most usually fails.
>
> - If communication seems to succeed in the intended way, there's a misunderstanding.
>
> - If you are content with your message, communication certainly fails.
>
> - If a message can be interpreted in several ways, it will be interpreted in a manner that maximizes the damage.
>
> From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws)

Human communication works best through interactive dialogues, with the opportunity for the receiver of information to react, disagree, rephrase or ask for more explanation. This feedback mechanism is essential to fix the curse of one-way human communication highlighted by Professor Wiio.

Alistair Cockburn has similar findings:

> To make communications as effective as possible, it is essential to improve the likelihood that the receiver can jump the communication gaps that are always present. The sender needs to touch into the highest level of shared experience with the receiver. The two people should provide constant feedback to each other in this process so that they can detect the extent to which they miss their intention.

A face-to-face, interactive and spontaneous form of documentation is the best way to improve on the fate of miscommunication highlighted by Professor Wiio. If all your stakeholders are happy with talking with the team for all questions and feedback, then change nothing. You don't need written documentation.

## The Rule of Three Interpretations

Jerry Weinberg writes in his book "Quality Software Management Vol 2 (Chapter 6)":

> Whenever I'm aware that I'm making an interpretation, I have another choice: I can allow myself to know that more than one interpretation is possible. A good check on premature interpretation is the **Rule of Three Interpretations**:
>
>  If I can't think of at least three different interpretations of what I received, I haven't thought enough about what it might mean.
>
> This rule slows down the Interpretation step and gives me, the receiver, a chance to engage my brain before using my mouth. Even after I have thought of three possible interpretations, however, I should always be aware of one more possibility: that my list still may not include your intending meaning.


## Obstacles to conversations

There would be no need for this pattern if people were having conversations so easily in the workplace. Unfortunately this is not the case often enough.


Years of working together by handing documents over the wall have trained many people at not having conversations, except in meetings where conversations become an art of negotiation. Corporate environments with politics and information retention have also trained colleagues at not sharing too much knowledge too early in order to remain in the game and to keep power, including blocking power.

People from different teams, departments, or assigned on different projects, in different locations, tend to have much less conversations than close neighbors in the same team and project. They tend to use colder (not interactive) and less effective modes of communication like email or phone calls instead of face-to-face communication. It's important to note that hierarchical distance -- not having the same management, is at least as great an impediment to having conversations than geographic distance.

Separation of people by functions in separate teams, like the Dev, QA and BA teams, is also a great way to make conversations less likely.

The idea of ownership of activities is another conversation-killer:

> - Product "Manager"
> - Product "Owner"
> - Scrum "Master"
>
> I have no idea why people aren't collaborating!
>
> -- Melissa Perri (@lissijean) on Twitter

Old clichÃ©s also reduce the likelihood that people even imagine meeting and talking together:

> "I'm a tester, I must wait for the development to be finished to start testing"
>
> "I'm a BA, so I must solve the problem by myself before handing it to the developers to implement"
>
> "I'm a developer, my job is to execute what's been specified beforehand, and my job is not to test it once it's done."

I've heard that some Business Analysts have a hard time imagining not producing documents of a large enough size, for fear that their work is not visible otherwise. Simply talking to help the project may not be enough to justify their role. Here we see how perverse this system has become, producing waste (large early documents) not for their value per se but to make the work visible to managers. Fear of losing your job or individual incentives feed this kind of counter-productive behaviors.


> Defect tracking systems certainly don't promote communication between programmers and testers. They can make it easy to avoid talking directly to each other.
> -- Agile Testing, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory

To improve on that, make sure that everybody knows that the only goal is to deliver value. Make the work environment safe for everyone. Even with much less documents, there's still a role for traditional BA and QA team members, it's just transforming into a continuous contribution to a collective adventure that we call a project or a product.

Make sure it's perfectly ok to just have conversations often, and spend less time writing stuff. Promote collective working over separate job posts. Have everyone, even from different teams, sit close to each other most of the time, around the same table if possible, so that spontaneous communication happens without obstacle.

## Knowledge Transfer sessions

Some teams plan *KT* (Knowledge Transfer sessions), often in addition to brief documents, to make sure the knowledge is actually shared and well understood. According to the Wiio's laws, that is a great idea! A typical example of KT is to exchange the knowledge on the deployment before a release, when the Ops are in another silo of the organization. One way to share knowledge in this case is to perform a dry run of the deployment, based on the deployment document and all the automated deployment manifests. This way, any issue, question or mistake can be spotted quickly during the session, and all this during regular working hours.

Of course an alternative is to directly work collectively between the developers and the Ops people to prepare, configure and document all the deployment process. KT can be a step in this direction for traditional companies, just like code reviews are a step towards pair-programming.

## Interactive Documentation

Written documents don't have the opportunity for interaction. As [Korpela](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/wiio.html) comments on the Wiio's laws, whenever a written document "such as a book or a Web page or a newspaper article, miraculously works, it's because the author participated in dialogues elsewhere.".

It takes more work than just typing text for a written document to be useful. Georges Dinwiddie [advises in his blog](http://blog.gdinwiddie.com/2010/08/06/the-use-of-documentation/) to "Document questions the reader may have" and to "Get it reviewed by multiple people". As such, the written documentation is like a record of an interactive conversation that worked, which makes it more likely to work again.

But we can also push the limits of written words on paper thanks to the available technologies all around us. We can create documentation that is interactive to some extent.

As an example, Gojko Adzic turned a checklist of test heuristics into an additional menu in the browser, as a small assistant called [BugMagnet](https://github.com/gojko/bugmagnet):

![BugMagnet](images/header-menu.png)

Clicking on the item "Names / NULL" in the menu directly fills the edit field in the browser with the string "NULL". This could have remained a plain checklist to input yourself manually into the forms, but Gojko made the extra step to make it a little more interactive. Note the suggestive effect of navigating the menu, it calls for being used, at least more than a printed checklist.

Therefore: **Whenever possible prefer documentation that is interactive over static written words. Use hypermedia to the content navigable through links. Turn the documentation into tools like checkers, tasks assistants or search engines.**


You already know several examples of interactive documentation, it is around us already:
- Hypermedia documentation with navigable links, as generated by Javadoc and equivalent systems in other languages
- Tools like Pickles which turn the Cucumber or Specflow reports into an interactive website, or Fitnesse which had always been interactive from the start.
- Tools like Swagger which document your web API into an interactive website, with built-in capability to directly send the requests and to show the responses
- Your IDE which offers a lot of documentation features with a keystroke or a mouse click: Call Stack, Search for type or reference, Type Hierarchy, Find occurrences, Find in the programming language Abstract Syntax Tree...


As described in Declarative Automation, promoting documentation into an automated form that is also readable allows for interactive discovery: you can execute and tinker the automation code (scripts and tests) to understand the topic more more in depth as you change it and see the effects.
