## Ideas Sedimentation

Conversations carry a lot of ideas quickly; at a lower pace some of these ideas tend to stabilize around a consensus and become ready to become materialized as documentation. Like sand in the water of the river.

@thomaslindqvist: The coordination of value delivery is too important to be left to documents. Let ppl deliver value to ppl

@tottinge: It's hard to know how to communicate if we have to begin with preventing all possible misinterpretations. @net_zer0 @craftsmanadam

> Picture: So you mean...? - not really, in fact rather the opposite, because... -oh I see so why about... - oh yes it's a great idea!

@maaretp: You want to write notes of what you're thinking, not about what happens on the computer @sgershon #sqats14
