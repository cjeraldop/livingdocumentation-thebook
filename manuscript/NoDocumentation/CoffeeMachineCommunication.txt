# Coffee Machine Communication

*Not all exchange of knowledge has to be planned and managed. Spontaneous discussions in a relaxed environment often work better and must be encouraged.*

Random discussions at the coffee machine or at the water fountain are invaluable. The best exchange of knowledge is spontaneous. You meet a colleague or two and start talking. Follows something like a content negotiation to find topics each of you is interested in. It may be on a non professional topic. In this case this is just bond-making, which is also invaluable. When it is on a professional topic, then nothing can beat this kind of communication.

You've chosen this topic because all of you have an interest in it. You have questions about your current tasks, and the other people are happy to help with answers or stories from their own experience.

I believe that this kind of communication is the best way to exchange knowledge there is. Topic is chosen freely from shared interests. It's interactive with questions and answers and a lot of spontaneous storytelling. It takes as long as required. I've already missed meetings because the discussion at the coffee machine was way more essential to a project than the meeting I was supposed to attend.

Open Space Technology used for meet ups and un-conferences replicates just that idea setting for larger groups. The rules of the two feet states that everyone is free to move where the topic is most interesting. The other principles say that "The people who are there are the right persons" and that "Whenever it starts it's the right time".

For all this to work there must be no hierarchy pressure around the coffee machine. Everybody is free to chat with the CEO without being specially formal or shy.

**Therefore: Don't discount the value of random discussions at the coffee machine, water fountain or in the relaxation area. Create opportunities for everyone to meet and talk at random, in a relaxed setting. Decree that the rank in the hierarchy must be ignored within all relaxed areas.**

Google and other web startups propose fantastic facilities to encourage people to meet and talk.

La Gaité Lyrique, a place for cultures in the digital age in Paris, has offices and meeting rooms, however the staff often prefers to host meetings in the foyers that are open to the public. They even serve beer there, but I haven't seen people from the staff drink beer during the day.

I've spent countless hours in their foyers writing this book. I've seen benefits that we miss in traditional work environments with closed meeting rooms.

**The atmosphere**: because it's mixed with people from the outside, many working, other having fun around a tea or even beer, the atmosphere is quite relax. This is more pleasant. I believe it also encourages thinking more creatively. You also have the choice of low sofas and lounge chairs, or dining tables with kitchen chairs. On a rather tense topic I'd go for the lounge setting each time! To work on a diagram, I'd chose the dining table.

**Impromptu discussions**: for example, the General Director had a meeting with two people from the staff. They didn't book a space. Once done with the discussion, he then looked around to see who was there, then went on to have very brief side discussions with colleagues that were attending another meeting in the foyer.

Thinking in retrospect of all the frustration of planning meetings with busy people, in boring meeting rooms in the company I was working for, I was jealous.

Being there with the staff also means I had the opportunity to ask questions to the director himself in an impromptu fashion. No appointment. No secretary to filter access. Wow.

The director definitely encourages informal meetings. Spending leisure time at the foyer instead of working is not a problem since everyone owns their responsibilities, regardless of how, when, where or how long they work. Impromptu meetings can be totally improvised, à la coffee machine, or just planned in an informal space, like in the coffee machine area.

All this is not suited for every case, of course. There is no guarantee you'll find the people you want to talk to around the coffee machine, unless you planned the meeting. There's also no flip chart, no whiteboard, and unfortunately no tele-conference system. And there is no privacy.
