## Zero documentation & Gamification


**An approach to force better naming and better practice in general to share knowledge without additional prose**


I've heard of a team who decided to forbid documentation: they're proudly doing Zero Documentation. And it isn't that stupid.

Once you understand that most of the time written documentation prose or diagram is a poor substitute for expressing the knowledge better within the work product itself in the first place, it makes sense to minimize it. And because it sounds radical and a bit insane, it's stimulating and becomes a game. This makes it more likely to stick in team members mind, driving their behavior for the better, hopefully.

I haven't tried it myself but what my colleague told me about it is that it's usually driving virtuous behavior in practice.

Because we don't all share the same definition of the word "documentation", a game of Zero Documentation must clarify its rules.
The above-mentioned team refuses comments in the code and on methods, all forms of written prose, external documents and traditional office documents. They happily embrace tests, Gherkin scenarios (Cucumber / Specflow), favor simple code, and enjoy working collectively as their primary mean of sharing knowledge. They're happy with all this.

I think augmenting the code with annotations, a README file kept simple and generating living documents still fits within the rules of the game. You decide when to put the cursor!
