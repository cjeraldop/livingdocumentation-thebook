Minimum Viable Documentation, README, and Zero Documentation Policy



> We have projects with short, badly written, or entirely missing documentation… There must be some middle ground between reams of technical specifications and no specifications at all. And in fact there is. That middle ground is the humble Readme.’

18F logo 18F Open Source Style Guide "Making READMEs readable"

https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/making-readmes-readable

> Every repo contains a README, which is a document that is intended to explain, at first glance, what a project does and how to install or test the code.

Example: The README for 18F’s Midas project starts out by answering the questions:

- What is Midas?
- How does Midas work?
- Who uses Midas?
- What is Midas’ goal?
- How can your organization benefit from using Midas?

The README should also contain:

- Instructions for how to develop, use, and test the code.
- Instructions for how people can help.
- List the licensing information for your project.
- List the contact information for your team as well as where to ask questions.
- Any other information that you’d like to share with users can go in the Wiki section of your repository.

When using an online source code repository like Github, avoid linking from the README to pages on the wiki: the README is versioned whereas the wiki is not, so links will break, in particular when cloning or forking.
