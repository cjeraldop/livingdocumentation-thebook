## Continuous Training

As general knowledge becomes more widespread, the less you need to document in average. Investing in continuous training is therefore a way to lower the need for documentation.

Learning standard skills also makes it more likely to  use more ready-made knowledge at the expense of original solutions. This is good the quality of the solution and because it alleviates the need for specific documentation.

More consistency of skills and shared culture also helps faster decision-making. It's not about removing all diversity in the team, since diversity is an essential ingredient. Still, we don't need all diversity in every detail, and there's a lot that we can make more consistent without loosing much.

Investing in continuous training can be done with:

- Coding Dojos on code kata, e.g at lunch time every Friday
- Short Training sessions during the day
- Interactive Mini-Trainings, e.g. half an hour twice a week right after lunch
- Time for deliberate practice, e.g. 20% time policy.
