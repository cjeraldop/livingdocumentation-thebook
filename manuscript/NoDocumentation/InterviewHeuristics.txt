# Modeling questions heuristics

## Before

- Do your homework: read about the topics, books, Google search, Wikipedia, investopedia, XML standards of the field.
- Know your patterns: design, DDD, analysis
- Train in various modeling techniques: CRC Cards, UML in Color, Event Storming etc.

## During interview

- Always ask **"WHY?"** (several times if needed)
- Ask **"FOR WHO?"** Identify stakeholders: "Who decides that?" "Who would disagree with that?"
- Note the exact words, **verbatim**.
- Don't interrupt the business people, **write down your questions** to ask them minutes later.
- While listening, **scan your notes** to find your next questions.
- On your notes, **mark each word mentioned for the first time**.
- Ask for the definition of each new words: **"How would you define X?"**.
- Ask often **"Gimme an example please!"** (you can't abuse this question).
- Challenge respectfully the domain experts: they may not always be right, they may even be wrong or lack perspective. Don't tell them they're wrong though.
- Pay attention to **side remarks**, and note them. They may reveal the hidden side of the iceberg.
- **Pay attention to hesitations and unconvincing answers**.
- Ask for clarification whenever it seems that **different words** are used indifferently: this may suggest distinct Bounded Contexts.
- Challenge internal consistency: confront two previous **statements that could contradict** with each other.
- Look for **invariants** (properties that should be always true).
- Challenge invariants, even obvious ones: **"in what conditions this would not be alway true?"**..
- Ignore technology: How was this done before we had computers?
- If you already suspect the relevance of a **known pattern** (e.g. Analysis Patterns), ask domain questions to know better..

## After

- Immediately code what you understood
- Note every question, hesitation, contradiction for the next interview

**Iterate**
