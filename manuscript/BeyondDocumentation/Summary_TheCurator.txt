# Summing it up: the curator preparing an art exhibition

## Selecting and organizing existing knowledge

The curator of an exhibition primarily decides on a key editorial focus. The focus usually becomes the title of the event. Sometimes the focus is trivial: "Claude Monet, the surrealism", but even in this case there is a decision for example to exclude prior art from the artist which was not surrealism.

> Any documentation initiative has deliver clearly one key message

Good exhibitions try to bring an amount of surprise: "You've always thought Kandinsky paintings were fully abstract, but we'll show how the abstract shapes evolved from his prior figurative paintings". You just come to watch the art pieces, but to also grow your culture and understand relationships between artists, art pieces and their era.

> Good documentation brings value added with new knowledge, emphasis on relationships, and a by offering a different perspective of things

## Selecting and organizing existing knowledge

The curator selects art works based on the chosen editorial focus. Most of the pieces available are left in the storage room, and only the few pieces of particular interest for the particular exhibit are on display.

> Documentation is a curation activity, to decide what's more important in a given perspective

He or she decides which to display in which room. A room may be organized around a time period, a phase in the life of the artist, or on a theme.

Art pieces may be displayed side by side in order to suggest comparisons between them. They may be displayed with an ordering which tells a story, chronological or by a succession of themes.

> Organization of knowledge is a key tool to add meaning to a plain collection of pieces of knowledge. We group elements by named folders, tags, or naming conventions.

## Adding what's missing when needed

The curator writes a few texts explaining the big idea of each section of the exhibition. She or he also writes small labels for each art work. These labels are then displayed next to the art piece.

> Documentation needs an augmentation of knowledge, using annotations, DSL or naming conventions. Some limited amount of text is useful too in some places. This knowledge is attached to the related code elements whenever possible.

When a work considered essential for the exhibition is not in the collection, it will be borrowed from another museum or from a private collection, or sometime even commissioned to the living artist. Sometimes the artist also contributes to the organizing of his or her pieces directly.

Sometime an information is missing. The curator can mandates researchers to conduct investigations, chemical on the painting or by looking at written archives, to find the missing piece in the puzzle of knowledge. For example Le Louvre museum exploits research results on the style of brushing colors on the canvas in order to tell the visitors how much Raphael really participated to each of his paintings. The Master did not touch many of them indeed!

> Documentation is a feedback mechanism which helps notice something is missing or wrong in the code, or in the related knowledge.

## Accessible for people who can't attend, and for posterity

The curator also creates a catalogue of the exhibition, which recaps all the content displayed: the explanative texts by section, the art pieces as quality pictures, their labels. The catalogue as a book usually follows a similar organization as the rooms in the exhibition venue.

Museums now offer exhibition catalogues in a full form, expensive and heavyweight, and also as a shorter form, with just a digest of the major pieces. I usually buy the shorter catalogue, which is a more attractive read by far!

> Documentation also cares about making accessible knowledge that is not, and for making sure the important pieces are persisted for the future. We publish content as documents and on an interactive website, targeted for different audiences and different needs.
