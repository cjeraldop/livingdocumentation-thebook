# Unorthodox Media

## Posters & Maxims & Domestic Ads:


Use wifi password as a maxim (you have to carefully type it manually!):
ReduceReuseRecycle


Electronic

## Domestic Ads:

Persona: not just for stereotypes of people, also for products, market data and typical situations to deal with.

banners on build walls, wallpaper, idle screens, pair-programming blocker screens...

Goodies

T-shirts, card decks, cheat sheets, large posters, mugs... with maxims and important messages / logo on.

## Maxims

T> **Pro Tip** Use wifi password as a maxim (you have to carefully type it manually!):

T> **Pro Tip** If it rhymes it's more credible

"if in doubt, do it the way Erlang does it @BeRewt

Ã  la Banksy street art

Some examples:

Are you awesome?
<Mr T. Picture>
Close the door once you're done.

You can turn technical recommendations into motivational maxims:

Fix a bug?
Add a test.

Fight Legacy code
Write unit tests

The only way to go fast is to go well

Mutable state kills.
<"poison" label on bottle manually overwritten with "orange juice" by mistake>
Kill mutable state!

Easy to do with a meme generator


## Infodecks

http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Infodeck.html

there are advantage to these infodecks.
- You can use spatial layout to help explanation
- They discourage long prose that people don't read
- It's easy to include diagrams as primary elements in the communication

"more approachable and easier to communicate information than a traditional prose text"

"Infodecks are an interesting form to me, if only because it seems nobody takes them seriously.""

"we are communicating on computer devices and not using paper. Modern computers have bright multi-color screens, and aren't worried about conserving paper. So a colorful, diagram-heavy approach that uses lots of virtual pages is an effective form of document - especially as tablets become more prevalent.""


## Drawing when you don't know how to draw

- Collage of stuff found on the Internet
Use icons, comics balloons
- Learn visual facilitation tips
- Practice on every occasion
- Search Google Images for similar stuff to find inspiration
- Tell stories, that involve people and their emotions
- 4 steps on one slide is perfect for a workflow
- 7 elements on a diagram is a lot already
- Don't mix perspectives
- Should be visible at a distance
- proximity, grouping and containment, horizontal and vertical directions and alignment matter

## Comics
Comics telling stories of frustrated users now, and their dream of a better software (explain project rationale). Or stories of users doing their job and sharing their most important stakes (explain fundamental business stakes).

I've used child-ish comics in very corporate environments to explain a process for the development team. I've used less child-ish comics to help explain a governance process to senior management too.

Cheat Sheet or Card Decks are also interesting media to spread important ideas, and may be branded too.

## Visualizations & Animations

Animations are perfect to explain temporal behaviors.

Company chat, and chatbot

## Congruent Media


## Gamification / playful

Offer interactive ways to share knowledge through attractive and engaging interactions
- mob programming, pairing (dev-dev, )
- timeboxing challenges
- arbitrary constraints challenges
- be weird manifesto, retrospectives experiments
- stackoverflow style social network, I like, retweets
- embedded games & contests
Taking into account human mechanisms of reward / effort to make it work



## Information Radiators


## Tangible Media

The most well-known examples of tangible documentation are : Build walls, Nabaztag etc. Other examples include the use of legos during meetings, and other avatars as well.

Furniture

Even your furniture tells stories. Perhaps each table represents a project team, perhaps the Mac hints at designers whereas Linux machines suggest developers.

3D printed models are now easy to produce. This means you could project a particular view of your application and print it in a solid material. This helps everyone use their visual and world-sensing strength to grasp visually and by touching the elements. 3D and removable layers are useful to represent several dimensions of the problem stacked on each other, and well aligned.
