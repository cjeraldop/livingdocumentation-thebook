# Affordable & Attractive

> Documentation should be attractive for the same reason flowers are attractive: for self-preservation. (paraphrasing Romeu Moura again)

## Specs Digest

*Small is Beautiful*

I've seen a project where the team decided to curate all the accumulation of design and specifications documents into a much shorter (about 10 pages-long)  "Specs Digest" document. This was mostly done by copy-pasting the best parts out of various existing documents, updated, fixed and supplemented with the obviously missing bits in the process. This digest was a highly-valued document in the team.

The digest is strongly organized into sections, each typically half-page long, with clear titles recap-ed in a table of contents. The structure is meant so that you can skip any section safely to jump directly to the part of interest.

The content mostly focuses on everything not obvious: business calculations (dates, eligibility, financial and risk calculations), principles and rules. But it may also describes key semi-technical aspects like the versioning scheme between multiple related concepts.

Note that if you already have a Living Documentation based on scenarios in a Cucumber-ish kind of tool, you should move all this content into the feature files themselves, or in side-car "preambule" markdown files in the same folders.

## Easter Eggs & Fun Anecdotes

*Having fun is the best way to learn*

Turn any kind of documentation into something more engaging by hiding anecdotes from the project, its sponsors and team members into the document, as a way to encourage and reading. Add simple illustrations.

As [Peter Hilton mentions in his talk on Documentation Avoidance](https://www.slideshare.net/pirhilton/documentation-avoidance):

> Use humour. There’s no rule that says that jokes aren’t allowed. Insufficiently serious documentation is probably not your biggest problem. Staying awake might be.

## Promoting News

Adding knowledge somewhere is not enough for its audience to notice and use it. Provide ways to promote the documentation, especially when it changes:

- "Recent Changes" page, the bare minimum
- Changes feed (Swagger...) pushed to Slack
- Slackbot custom replies, to remind where's the doc is in response to keywords
- Release notes: do you really read them?
- Journalism by a real person: when you're really serious about knowledge sharing, hire a real professional journalist on-site!

This paragraph is too short for this very important topic. Unfortunately it's so hard I don't have miracle solutions here...
