# Unorthodox Media

The corporate world tends to be unoriginal. When it comes to documentation,
the traditional media remain the Mighty Email, MS Office with the boring mandatory templates, SharePoint, and all the various Enterprise tools notorious for their outstanding User Experience.

**But life does not have to be so dull. Shake up your team or department by using unexpected Unorthodox Media for your communication and your documentation purposes!**

Below are various ideas to use as inspirations to spice up your communication in general, and which can be useful to share knowledge and objectives.

## Maxims

When your current initiative is to improve the code quality:

> Fix a bug?
> Add a test.

Or

> Fight Legacy code
> Write unit tests

Don't directly copy and paste these maxims. Create yours that will stick in your culture. The only way to know if a maxim stick is to tell it out loud on different occasions, to see if you resonates and if anyone mentions it later.

A> You may read the book *Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die* by Chip Heath and Dan Heath on this topic.

When your project is to rewrite only a portion of a large legacy system, and you don't want to rewrite more than what's absolutely useful now, that is the billing engine and nothing else:

> One work site at a time (the billing engine)

With the corollary of being conservative when working in the legacy code that will not be rewritten:

> When in Rome, do as Roman do (don't revamp everything in the legacy)

Good maxims are useful and amusing at the same time:

> If in doubt, do it the way Erlang does it. (from by @BeRewt on Twitter)

Once you have a maxim, your job is to repeat it as often as possible (without becoming a spammer of course).

T> Repetition also works inside a maxim. For example "Mutable state kills. Kill mutable state!" has internal repetition which can help make it more memorable.

A maxim has to remain trivially simple, because complicated stuff does not scale over larger audiences. You want to broadcast your maxims. Therefore, be ready to trade nuance for stickiness. You can only tell one or two key messages. Make sure these are the most important messages. Take care of the other less important messages in a different way.

T> **Pro Tip** Statements that rhyme are more believable than those that don't. This is [the rhyme-as-reason effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyme-as-reason_effect) (or Eaton-Rosen phenomenon)

## Posters & Domestic Ads

Consider your communication like a marketing campaign. You can use the same tools, internally.

Once you have maxims, you can turn them into illustrated posters.

The first thing you can do is start with an image search. For example consider this maxim:

> The only way to go fast is to go well!

Searching on Google Image shows a ready-made image meme with this exact text and with Uncle Bob picture. This is no surprise considering that he like to repeat this maxim. And by the way this maxim also exhibits internal repetition and symmetry around the word 'go', which makes it more sticky.

## Meme-based posters

Now consider another you don't have your maxim yet but you'd like everyone to remember to close the door of the bathroom after use. Let's create a motivational poster for that!

That's easy with all the available free online *meme generators*. From a given idea you can browse the most common memes until you find one that fits the message best. Here we found a "Mr T" meme (this example is a real one I've seen at a customer site. The poster was awesome on the bathroom door.)

![Mr T. Picture: Are you awesome?
Close the door once you're done.](images/areyouawesome.jpg)

One drawback of memes is that they tend to become annoying when used too frequently.


T> **Pro Tip** Display Cute Kitten along or between your messages. Everybody loves cute kitten!


## Information Radiators

Posters don't necessarily have to be printed and pinned on the walls or windows to be visible. Some companies have TV sets on the walls or in the lifts with a carousel of slides for internal communication. This is a nice place for your posters.

The downside is that you probably have to go through an acceptance process, and you may be rejected.

Still, you can insert your posters as banners into your build walls, screen savers, or pair-programming blocker screen!


## Very Short Story, Humor, Cheap media, and implicit message

You may have seen this very cheap yet quite efficient poster already:

![](images/noprojects_poster.jpg)

Storytelling is very powerful, even when this short. It takes training or pure luck to author this kind of gem. Fortunately you can reuse (steal or hijack) many existing such gems for your own purposes. Twitter is a great source of very short, and often funny, stories to plagiarize. But keep in mind that having everyone doing it does not mean it's legal.

## Digital Native!

Maxims can be so short they can fit within a hashtag. This is a popular practice on Twitter, with hashtags like "BlackLivesMatter". Our software industry also loves hashtags as a way to name new practices: [#NoEstimates](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NoEstimates), [#BeyondBudgeting](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BeyondBudgeting), or [#NoProject](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23noprojects).

Note that hashtags are not just for Twitter or Facebook. You can use them IRL (In Real Life), and even verbally, which sounds deliciously awkward.


T> **Pro Tip** Use wifi password as a maxim (you have to carefully type it manually! For example, if like in my company Arolla you'd like to encourage environment-friendly behavior, you could rename your wifi network or wifi code as "ReduceReuseRecycle".

## Goodies

Goodies are not always green, but sometime they are useful. Goodies are a traditional way to repeat a message, and it does not have to be your brand, it can be a maxim too.

The conference DDD Europe recently did a great job at that with 3 different T-shirt designs with 3 different maxims, for example:

- MAKE THE IMPLICIT EXPLICIT
- THROW AWAY THE MODEL

![MAKE THE IMPLICIT EXPLICIT blue t-shirt](images/tshirt.jpg)

Most typical goodies are T-shirts, card decks, cheat sheets, large takeaway posters, mugs, pens, postcards, stickers, sweets, relaxation widgets...

## Comics

Comics are compelling ways to tell a story, for example a story of frustrated users now, with their dream of a better software. This can be used to document and explain the rationale for a new project.

Stories of users doing their job and sharing their most important stakes are also great to explain hence document in an accessible way the fundamental business stakes of a business activity.

I've used child-ish comics in very corporate environments to explain a process for the development team. I've used less child-ish comics to help explain a governance process to senior management too, in a real big serious bank. It worked and was appreciated.

There are several online comics generators which can help create basic comics from libraries of characters, settings and effects. This makes it possible to anyone to create a comics, even without any drawing skill. 


## Infodecks

Infodecks are slides used as documents to be read on screen rather than projected in front of an audience. As Martin Fowler writes, they are "more approachable and easier to communicate information than a traditional prose text"

Infodecks offer many advantages:

- You can use spatial layout to help explanation
- They discourage long prose that people don't read
- It's easy to include diagrams as primary elements in the communication

The important thing is not to confuse infodecks with slide decks meant to be projected to a large audience. When projected, there should very little text, using a very big font size, along with many illustrations.

"Infodecks are an interesting form to me, if only because it seems nobody takes them seriously. [...] A colorful, diagram-heavy approach that uses lots of virtual pages is an effective form of document - especially as tablets become more prevalent." -- [Martin Fowler bliki](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Infodeck.html)



## Visualizations & Animations

A bit more difficult to produce, animations and animated visualizations are perfect to explain temporal behaviors.

A great example is the beautiful [visualization of Distributed Consensus in Raft]() http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/) which shows how the nodes elect their leader in the face of various events.

Another personal favorite is the apparently crazy idea of showing [how sort algorithms work](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg) using sound along with crude display:

## Lego blocks

Lego block have become popular among Agile circles over the past years, so now we can use legos during meetings, as a planning tool, or even to represent a software architecture physically in 3D. Other system of avatars or construction blocks can be used as well as a mediation tool during conversations. The problem with these constructions is that usually nobody can understand what they meant after a few days.

## Furniture

Even your furniture can tell stories. Fred Georges explained in one of his talks how the tables expressed literally the internal organization of a startup: each table represents one project team. No more room on the table means the team has reached its maximal size. Otherwise you're welcome to join the team if you feel like to! It's a direct proposition!

Furthermore, you can tell from the huge iMac screens where the designers are, whereas Linux machines more likely suggest developers are working there.

## 3D printed stuff

3D printed models are now easy to produce. This means you could project a particular view of your application and print it in a solid material. This helps everyone use their visual and world-sensing strength to grasp visually and by touching the elements. 3D and removable layers are useful to represent several dimensions of the problem stacked on each other, and well aligned.
