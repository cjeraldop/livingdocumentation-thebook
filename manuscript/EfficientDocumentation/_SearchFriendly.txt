## Search-First Documentation

Making information available is not enough. You have to know where to find what you need when you need it (navigation and search)

Table of content: easy to index, structure hard to apply to tasks
Vs
Task-oriented documentation: hard to index, missing a lot of overview explanation
Vs
Guerrilla documentation: SO, forum... Signal to noise not too good, user-created, stale

-> search-first: users-needs-driven like guerrilla, indexed like toc, modular like tasks, with tags and keywords

tags and keywords: even words that don't occur in the documentation, words like blue screen of death... Use the words from actual users, failed searches etc

Remember to mention synonyms, antonyms, and faux-sens and common confusions, for improved discoverability by search.
