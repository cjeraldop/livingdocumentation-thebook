Table of content: easy to index, structure hard to apply to tasks
Vs
Task-oriented documentation: hard to index, missing a lot of overview explanation
Vs
Guerrilla documentation: SO, forum... Signal to noise not too good, user-created, stale

## Emotional Impact
Make it dramatic! The detergent ads model

## Storytelling

## Stakeholders Profiles (aka Personas)
Stakeholders are important and should be well-understood. Write a few sentences to describe what's their job and what matters most for them. Ideally a few concrete stories of how it's like to be a CFO or a risk officer for a day, help a lot.

## Live my life / On-site visit or Virtual Tour
For a day, in real life or through a virtual tour

## Landscape Mapping
it's hard to talk and decide on a war strategy without at least some maps of the landscape, with named regions. On a software project a map of the business landscape is a great help too so that even people who's never been there can participate. Such a map is a form if Ubiquitous Language, organized visually.

## Meaningful Layout
when drawing diagrams use layout to express meaning: symmetries, vertical vs horizontal axis, proximity, boundaries and containment...

## Drawing when you don't know how to draw

- Collage of stuff found on the Internet
Use icons, comics balloons
- Learn visual facilitation tips
- Practice on every occasion
- Search Google Images for similar stuff to find inspiration
- Tell stories, that involve people and their emotions
- 4 steps on one slide is perfect for a workflow
- 7 elements on a diagram is a lot already
- Don't mix perspectives
- Should be visible at a distance
- proximity, grouping and containment, horizontal and vertical directions and alignment matter

## Tangible Media

Tangible media are things you can touch and which can communicate information.

Some examples of digital tangible media are the USB traffic light to tell the status of the build, the USB Missile Launcher to fire a missile on some event or the Fliike real-time Facebook Like Counter by smiirl to display the number of likes on Facebook.

Offer interactive ways to share knowledge through attractive and engaging interactions:

- Time-boxed challenges
-
- arbitrary constraints challenges
- be weird manifesto, retrospectives experiments
- stackoverflow style social network, I like, retweets
- embedded games & contests
Taking into account human mechanisms of reward / effort to make it work
