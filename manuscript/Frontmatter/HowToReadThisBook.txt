# How to read this book?

This book is on the topic of Living Documentation, and it is organized as a network of related patterns. Each pattern stands on its own, and can be read independently. However to fully understand and implement a pattern, there is usually the need to have a look at other related patterns, by reading their thumbnail at a minimum.

I'd like to make this book a *Duplex Book*, a book format suggested by Martin Fowler: The first part of the book is kept short and focuses on a narrative that is meant to be read cover-to-cover. In this form of book, the first part goes through all the content without diving too much into the details, while the rest of the book is the complete list of detailed patterns descriptions. You can read of course this second part upfront, or you may also keep it as a reference to go to whenever needed.

Unfortunately a Duplex book is hard to do at first try, and the book you are reading at the moment is not one yet. Feel free to skim, dig one area, and read it in any order, though I know readers who enjoyed reading it cover to cover.
