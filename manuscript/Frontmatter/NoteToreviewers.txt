# Note to reviewers

Many thanks for reading this first version of my book!

Don't hesitate to share your feedback, even if on one single part or section.

I especially need feedback on:

- **What is interesting and needs to be elaborated in more details**
- What is not or less interesting
- **What you strongly disagree with, or you think is plain wrong**
- Suggestions of any additional examples
- Suggestions of any additional illustrations
- More generally, overall feedback on the content more than on form

Also if you have already put in practice some of the ideas of the book and want to be quoted about it, don't hesitate to tell me about it.

I know the current book has a lot of :

- Poorly written sentences (English is not my native language, and the text has not be edited yet)
- Typos (not fully spell-checked yet)
- Low-quality images or too large images


Please send all feedback or other comment through the Leanpub feedback form:
