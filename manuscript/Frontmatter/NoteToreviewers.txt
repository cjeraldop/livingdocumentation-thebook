# Note to reviewers

Many thanks for reading this early draft of the book! This is work-in-progress, so everything can change at anytime, although the more it will change the more work for me.

I need your feedback. Please, don't hesitate to send me your feedback, even if you only read one chapter.

I especially need feedback on:

- **What is interesting and needs to be elaborated in more details**
- What is not or less interesting
- **What you strongly disagree with, or you think is plain wrong**
- Suggestions of any additional examples
- Suggestions of any additional illustrations
- More generally, overall feedback on the content, not form

Also if you have already put in practice some of the ideas of the book and want to be quoted about it, don't hesitate to tell me about it.

Please **don't** send me feedback (not yet) about:

- Poorly written sentences
- Typos
- Low-quality images

There would be too many issues to raise (I'm not English-native). The copy-editing will be done later.

Please send all feedback or other comment through the Leanpub feedback form:

(or at my personal email if you manage to get it :)

Thanks!
