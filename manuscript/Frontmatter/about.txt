# About this book

> "Make very good documentation, without spending time outside of making a better software"


The book "Specification by Example" has introduced the idea of a "Living Documentation", where an example of behavior used for documentation is promoted into an automated test. Whenever the test fails, it signals the documentation is no longer in sync with the code so you can just fix that quickly.

This has shown that it is possible to have useful documentation that doesn't suffer the fate of getting obsolete once written. But we can go much further.

This book expands on this idea of a Living Documentation, a documentation that evolves at the same pace than the code, for many aspects of a project, from the business goals to the business domain knowledge, architecture and design, processes and deployment.

This book is kept short, with illustrations and concrete examples. You will learn how to start investing into documentation that is always up to date, at a minimal extra cost thanks to well-crafted artifacts and a reasonable amount of automation.

You don't necessarily have to chose between Working Software and Extensive Documentation!
