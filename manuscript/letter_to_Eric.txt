Hi Eric,
With 300+ pages, 80K+ words and 300+ readers on Leanpub, my book is now taking shape, and I'd love to get some feedback from you! Most of the raw text content is there now.

The book is available on Leanpub: https://leanpub.com/livingdocumentation and can still be grabbed for free as it's still an unedited draft.

Do you like it? How do you see the relationship with DDD? Are there any major flaws in the content? I don't necessarily expect you read it all of course, but you probably have your own tricks on how to judge a book quickly.

I'd especially need your guidance on the next steps regarding editing and publishing through Pearson - Addison-Wesley: is it the right moment to contact them? Can you introduce me? Do you feel this book could belong to a DDD series? If not, what should I change, or could it belong to a "Eric Evans signature" series instead? If all that is not possible, who would you recommend me to contact?

We may have a Hangout about that if you prefer talking over writing.

Thanks!
Cyrille
