> Every repo contains a README, which is a document that is intended to explain, at first glance, what a project does and how to install or test the code.

Example: The README for 18F’s Midas project starts out by answering the questions:

- What is Midas?
- How does Midas work?
- Who uses Midas?
- What is Midas’ goal?
- How can your organization benefit from using Midas?

The README should also contain:

- Instructions for how to develop, use, and test the code.
- Instructions for how people can help.
- List the licensing information for your project.
- List the contact information for your team as well as where to ask questions.
- Any other information that you’d like to share with users can go in the Wiki section of your repository.

When using an online source code repository like Github, avoid linking from the README to pages on the wiki: the README is versioned whereas the wiki is not, so links will break, in particular when cloning or forking.
