LD - Architecture

"Disseminating Architectural Knowledge on Open-Source Projects" to appear @ICSEconf looked at @aosabook . Preprint: bit.ly/1nRF5iX

> Large software systems realize a number of important design decisions that are intended to remain stable. These decisions and the properties they induce are often referred to as a software system’s architecture. Knowledge of a system’s architecture helps ensure the preservation of its conceptual integrity in the face of on-going modifications.

> an architecture must be documented for stakeholders to take it into account

--
Many approaches on codifying architecture have been proposed in the last decades, yet it appears none of them is universally used.

Essay style documentation... the multiple lens hypothesis, which states that "architectural information is focused from four different types of lenses: (1) technical, (2) historical, (3) personal, and (4) social."

At least one diagram in each essay

> Under 10% of diagrams across all 45 chapters (14/164) were drawn in UML, and no chapter author predominantly relied on UML.

> when doodling a diagram I make sure I don’t expect people to know some conventions in order to understand it...”P3;“In my opinion most readers are not well versed in UML”

> Background information was also provided to give the reader a historical perspective which, in some cases, was intended to illuminate the rationale for some ar- chitectural decisions. “An architectural design document would have been very dry and artificial, since it would have described the engineering features [...], without explaining why they came to be”

- the general structure of the project, a "broad overview"
- Or internals: List of main features or key aspects
- Chronological
- Task-oriented: structured the chapter “around a minimal working [...] script”

Topic sequence:
- bottom-up (i.e., details first)
- top-down
- enumeration: We just identified the big topics [...] and wrote a section on each

Ranking
- descending order of importance, or increasing complexity

# Evolution

> A system’s evolution was an active driver of architectural description. History can inform your understanding of the structure

> it was important to describe how the architecture had progressed as opposed to presenting it fully formed. This can explain how we changed style and now both styles co-exist.

The community in open source is a big part of the architecture. In companies, skills sets and main influencers shaped the outcome. Knowing about that also informs the understand of the end result.

Documenting in essay form is always personal as well and reflects the personality of the author.


# Documenting as an outsider

Your exploration can be turned into a documentation! Sketches, notes, main eureka moments etc.
