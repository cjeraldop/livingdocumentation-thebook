# Documenting the business knowledge



## Scenario's Digest
annotate scenarios with intrinsic properties: nominal, sexy... so that to automatically extract a digest of them for a particular editorial purpose: user manual, stakeholders-specific documentation, one-tip-a-day etc

## Code Digest
Not all code is worth reading. Books typically show some very cleaned-up version

## Signal Noise Ratio & other metrics to monitor
DDD tactical patterns, Clean Code

Compute alignment metrics:
- outbound dependencies to deprecated stuff
- total inbound dependencies to deprecated stuff
- ratio of words from Ubiquitous Language within scenarios or other general text documentation
- broken links
- word clouds & missing definition for lost popular words
- rate of technical jargon within Ubiquitous Language etc, as defined from blacklists
- violations of rules etc


## Compiled Sample Code
Don't manually copy paste sample code, embed a link to code actually compiled. This applies to user guides and Javadoc-like comments.

## Curated Datasets
Carefully selected Datasets that represent a specific situation of interests. It may be typical, or extreme, or whatever is of interest from a business domain standpoint. Curated or Generated Datasets can be named and can belong to the Ubiquitous Language.


## Visible Tests
Tests that produce an output for human review
