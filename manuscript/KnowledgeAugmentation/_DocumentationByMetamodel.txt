# Documentation by Meta-Model

*Sometime the best media to describe code is just code.*

Compared to free text, code has many advantages: it's structured, offers auto-completion thanks to your IDE, is checked by the compiler, can itself be documented and annotated, and still has all the benefits of being plain text.

This makes code a great tool for documentation purposes!

As an example, let's describe a full Information System using code as a model. We'll see how we can even use this model to reason about our system and its testing strategy.
