Tip 68
"Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On"

"In general, comments should discuss why something is done, its purpose and its goal. The code already shows how it is done, so commenting on this is redundantâ€”and is a violation of the DRY principle."

What we don't want:
Misleading names
Hungarian notation
Revision history -> source control
List of files this file uses -> parser or dependency manifest
