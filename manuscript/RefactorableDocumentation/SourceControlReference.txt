# Source Control is the Reference

Source code has to be in source control. Period. What's the latest version of the code? It's easy, it's the code in the Mainline.

For non source code there's more opportunity for ambiguity. Knowledge in text documents, slides or spreadsheets may be stored anywhere in many different places. "Where is the latest version of the project goals? - Mmmh, I don't remember, have a look in the shared drive, otherwise in the wiki or the intranet."

We don't want to spend time chasing the latest decisions, or  discussing what version of document to trust. No ambiguity requires simple rules.

Therefore: **Any change should always be materialized as a commit.**

No exception, or it would defeat the whole thing. Every piece of knowledge that is important for the project should be committed to the source control. Favor plain text documents whenever possible.

When this pattern is not possible, a variant is to keep links to the right documents and to external repositories in the source control. To reduce link maintenance, consider using a Link Registry.

In this ultimate approach, every changes requires a commit, with a commit comment. The commit can also trigger a build. The build can produce the latest version of all living documents, publish them where appropriate, send events to news feeds or company chat.
