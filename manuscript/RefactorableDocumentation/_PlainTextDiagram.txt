# Plain-Text Diagram

Tools that take a bunch of text files to render them into beautiful documents can help. Here are some examples:

- Markdown, yaml, even json for the content in itself, plus tools to render that into other documents
- interactive slideshow from markdown files with Reveal.js
- ASCIIDoc
- d3.js

- Diagrammr-like
- Structurizr


# Diagram in Code

An alternative flavor of a plain-text diagram would be to use code as a way to declare the nodes and their relationships. There are benefits

- You benefit from auto-completion
- The code will benefit from the automated refactoring to remain in sync with all changes

and some drawbacks too

- Code itself is less readable by non-developers
- Identifiers names cannot contain whitespace
